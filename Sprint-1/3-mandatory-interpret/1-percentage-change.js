// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
/*
there is 2 function calls
carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));
*/


// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
// Error was coming from line 5. Missing ',' to separate "," string from "". Fixed by separating them with ,

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
// / variable reassignment statements are 4 and 5 . Strings reassigned to number

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
// 1, 2, 7, 8 lines of code are variable declarations

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
// its removing ',' from string to convert string to number. if we didn't did so, output would be NaN
